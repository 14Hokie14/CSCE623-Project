<h1>CSCE 623 Project</h2>

This repository is going to store all of the python scripts and Jupytr notebooks that I used to create the results for my project in CSCE 623 at AFIT. Below is the name of each of the scripts/notebooks and a brief description of each. 

* Training Test Splitter.py - A simple script that reads in a csv file and splits it into a training and test sets
* KFold File Generator.py - A simple script that I didn't end up using to generate my results, but if you needed a script to read in a csv file and break it up into K training and validation sets this would do it for you. 
* Feature Engineering.ipynb - A notebook that goes into how I set up the TF-IDF vectors for my two ML models
* Feature Engineering - Random Forest.ipynb - A notebook that sets up the TF-IDF vectors then performs cross validation to tune the hyperparameters for a Random Forest Classifier, then creates the model and runs the test data against it. 
* Feature Engineering - KNN.ipynb - A notebook that sets up the TF-IDF vectors then performs cross validation to tune the hyperparameters for a KNN Classifier, then creates the model and runs the test data against it.
