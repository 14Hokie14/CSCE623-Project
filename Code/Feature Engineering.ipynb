    "This notebook will handle the feature engineering for my CSCE 623 project. The steps followed are:  \n",
    "1. **Label coding**: creation of a dictionaryto map each category to a code.  \n",
    "2. **Text representation**: use of TF-IDF scores to represent the text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A number of things have already been done to the data set before this process happens. First the actual text was cleaned to include removing of any html tags, turned to lowercase, punctuation was removed, tokenized, and lemmatization. Then the entire data set was split into a 80-20% split of training and test data. Then that training subset was split up into training and validation subsets for k-fold cross validation, with k = 5.\n",
