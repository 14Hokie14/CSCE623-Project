Its mission is to promote quality housing and diverse, thriving neighborhoods for New Yorkers through loan and development programs for new affordable housing, preservation of the affordability of the existing housing stock, enforcement of housing quality standards, and educational programs for tenants and building owners. HPD is tasked with fulfilling Mayor de Blasioâ€™s Housing New York Plan which was recently expanded and accelerated through Housing New York 2.0 to complete the initial goal of 200,000 homes two years ahead of schedule by 2022, and achieve an additional 100,000 homes over the following four years, for a total of 300,000 homes by 2026.  The Office of Enforcement and Neighborhood Services works closely with other HPD divisions and outside community partners to identify buildings with violation problems, assess and develop appropriate strategies to address those properties, and work closely with responsible owners to develop a plan to improve conditions and return buildings to firm financial footing and physical health. HPD uses enforcement tools within the Division of Code Enforcement, Housing Litigation Division, Emergency Repair Program or the Division of Special Enforcement to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory obligations.  The Office of Enforcement and Neighborhood Services is composed of 8 divisions: â€¢	Preservation Services Exec Office (EXEC), Data Management & Technology (DMT), Division of Neighborhood Preservation (DNP), Administration & Internal Compliance (AIC), Housing Litigation Division (HLD), Division of Code Enforcement (DCE), Emergency Operations Division (EOD), Division of Special Enforcement (DSE)  Your Impact: The Division of Special Enforcement â€˜s Alternative Enforcement Program (AEP) is an enforcement program which identifies the 250 most distressed multiple dwellings citywide each year.

Office Finance & Admin,"The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) is the nationâ€™s largest for-hire transportation agency, licensing and regulating the Cityâ€™s yellow and green taxicabs, for-hire vehicles (including apps like Uber, Lyft, Via, and Juno), commuter vans, and luxury limousines. TLC develops and enforces rules to promote safety, transparency, as well as consumer and driver protection for a vital mode of transport in New York City. The vehicles, businesses, and drivers licensed and regulated by the agency move over one million people a day. With the introduction of new apps and technologies, TLC is on the front lines of a changing mobility landscape.  To learn more about the TLC, please visit: www.nyc.gov/taxi. In May 2019, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered a 45-day review of practices by brokers in the taxi industry. TLC-licensed brokers represent clients in the purchase or sale of a taxicab medallion. The review evaluated whether brokers violated existing TLC rules and recommended policy changes to identify and avoid potential broker conflicts and clarify brokersâ€™ duty to act in the best interest of their clients.  TLC is expanding its capacity to conduct ongoing reviews of this nature by creating a new Business Practices Accountability Unit (BPAU).  The unitâ€™s mission is to protect TLC drivers and medallion owners from unfair or misleading industry practices by TLC-licensed businesses.   Working in the Division of Finance and Administration, the BPAU Analysts will promote greater accountability and transparency of business practices in the for-hire transportation sector.  The Analysts will collaborate with agency partners to promote sound business practices, and investigate violations of TLC rules and relevant local, state or federal regulations.  Building upon the 45-day review of broker practices, the analysts will evaluate other TLC-licensed businesses and undertake a comprehensive review of existing TLC rules governing TLC-licensed business conduct to identify areas where new regulations are needed to protect drivers and medallion owners.  The analysts will work with other divisions within TLC, including licensing, prosecution and external affairs, on any necessary revisions to the licensure and renewal process, assisting in investigation of rule violations by TLC-licensed businesses, and educating drivers of their rights when working with a TLC-licensed business.       Duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to: 	 â€¢	Design and conduct periodic, high-level reviews of business practices of TLC brokers and other business entities, such agents, fleets, high-volume for hire services, and technology service providers, to ensure compliance with TLC rules and relevant local, state, and federal regulations.   â€¢	Develop investigative plans and strategies based on tips about bad behavior and analysis of complaints data, as well as random sampling.  Monitor companies suspected of engaging in suspicious practices. â€¢	Serve as a subject matter expert in analyzing complex business practices, and analyze external factors impacting the financial stability of the industry (e.g., medallion lending practices).  Research the business practices of TLC licensed entities and evaluate risks to the industry.  â€¢	Conduct research and investigations involving examinations of records, interviews of subjects and witnesses, and on-site inspections, collaborating as needed with other agencies within the City. â€¢	Collect, verify, and analyze documents subject to audit, including TLC data, financial records, public assistance records, and other records derived from law-enforcement databases and City and State agencies.  Conduct conflicts of interest reviews of annual disclosure reports.  â€¢	Carry out in-depth reviews that may be required as part of TLC licensing and renewal applications for businesses, as well as medallion transfers.   â€¢	Assist in the development of an outreach plan to inform TLC drivers and owners of their rights, and to ensure that they know how to contact us and submit a formal complaint for investigation and possible prosecution if they feel they are seeing suspicious or predatory behavior. â€¢	Analyze key metrics and develop best practices to guard against predatory lending.  Conduct surveys and analyses of licensee finances, such as medallion debt, as required by rule or law. â€¢	Draft written reports and internal memoranda that concisely present findings and recommendations for appropriate action to be taken following investigations.  Prepare any annual or periodic reports required by statute or otherwise requested by TLC senior staff, City Hall, City Council, and other interested parties. â€¢	Work in close coordination with other government investigative agencies.  Represent TLC at community meetings, outreach events, and public hearings.   â€¢	Analyze and evaluate risks and controls relevant to TLCâ€™s internal departments, policies and procedures.  Make recommendations to improve internal business practices.    â€¢	Manage external audits conducted by local, state, and federal auditors. â€¢	Additional duties include, but are not limited to, handling special projects and research assignments assigned by the Assistant Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner.","1.
